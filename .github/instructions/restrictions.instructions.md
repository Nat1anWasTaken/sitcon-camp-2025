## File Creation Restrictions

### Markdown Files
Do not create any markdown files (.md, .markdown) in this repository unless explicitly requested by the user. This includes:
- README files
- Documentation files
- Note files
- Any other markdown content

If the user specifically asks for a markdown file to be created, you may proceed, but otherwise avoid creating markdown files automatically.
